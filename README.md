LinkedIn-j-Email-Example-Android
================================

This project provides an example of how to use the Linkedin-j api to retrieve user email for an android application

The code I used came from here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5804257/posting-linkedin-message-from-android-application

I combined this with the jar from this post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16710194/not-getting-email-address-from-linkedin

Putting them together, I was able to create an example application that allows users to easily pull email or any other 
piece of information from linkedin.
